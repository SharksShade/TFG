# TFG
The objective of this TFG is to create a robot which can solve the Rubik’s cube from any starting configuration. We have decided to build an enveloping structure which hosts 6 stepmotors, which are used to twist each of the cube’s faces. In order to solve the cube, we’ve used an implementation of Kociemba’s algorithm in Raspberry Pi, which allows us to enter the initial state of the cube via an user interface, and produces a quasi-optimized solution after a programmable processing time. The solution consists of an array of characters, each representing a turn of the faces of the cube, which are oriented following a reference system based on relative positions. This array is then fed to the series port of the Arduino Uno tasked with the motor control, which translates it into instructions for the motors and then executes them.
